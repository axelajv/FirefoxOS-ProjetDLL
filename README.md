A starter kit for Ember

Your Ember.js project is almost ready! Here's how to get started:

- Start writing your app in `js/app.js`.

- Describe your application HTML in `index.html`.

- During development, you can link to `js/libs/ember-*.js` to get the
  unminified version of Ember.js.

- Add CSS to `css/style.css`.

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
